# Mytri's First CS193 Homework

## Things I like about CS 193

A couple of things I like about CS 193:

- __Practical approach:__ I really like the fact that our first homework is practical and hands on, unlike most of the other lectures which make quiz us on our syllabus. I've had a lot of fun making different types of changes and reviewing them on my website.
- __Fun homework:__ Yeah, essectially the same things said before, and the fact that future homeworks are going to be more hands on coding assignments, which I am looking forward to.
- __Real life application:__ One thing I found unique about this course is how it immiediately starts off with creating a github account and working on it, rather than just starting off with programming languages and computer architecture. I really like how the course is preparing us for the future by familiarizing us with tools we may most likely be using for jobs.
- __The professors:__ Unlike most f my other classes, the professors in this course are actually students like us. Just a bonus, having people the same age as us teaching us will not only make course material more relatable, but also reduce power hirearchies in lectures and enhance comfort when asking doubts.
- __And...yeah!:__ Not much else I can say, I've only had one CS 193 lecture...
